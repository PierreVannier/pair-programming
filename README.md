# Pair Programming Atom package
<span style="color:#F26;">
**This package is still under heavy development...**
</span>

This atom package allows you to **broadcast your atom text editor** in real time on the web.
The idea is to be able to create **"programming channels"** just as **"Youtube channel"**. It's sometimes fun to look at others programming (I wonder whether it's a normal behaviour though...). <br/>
It might just also be interesting in terms of learning good habits, learning best practices or even finding bugs.<br/>

This package can also be used for **teaching concerns**. For example, you have a class of people learning to code. You activate the package and ask the students to connect the channel and participate in a coding session.

This is a kind of "Twitch for code" (I don't really subscribe to this X for Y but...).

I'm quite new to atom package and coffeescript so there are probably some ugly things here and there but it's here at least :-)
I'll try to make it live and maintain this package on a regular basis.

On the other hand, It'll be awesome to create an API (on the server side) for other editor fans to be able to develop package for other editor (sublime, emacs, vi etc...)
